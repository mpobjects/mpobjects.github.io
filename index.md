**Welcome to MP Objects' GitHub page**

Please visit the [github page](https://github.com/mpobjects) for an overview of various OpenSource projects of [MP Objects](https://www.mp-objects.com).

# Project Highlights

## jstack.review

[jstack.review](https://jstack.review/) is a javascript based analyzer of JVM thread dumps. It runs completely client side, so no sensitive information is send to any server.

It is based on the thread dump analyzer started by Spotify and extended with a whole bunch of additional features.

## wicket4 webjars

[wicket4-webjars](https://github.com/mpobjects/wicket4-webjars) is a backport of the [wicket-webjars](https://github.com/l0rdn1kk0n/wicket-webjars) library for Wicket 1.4.x.

It will allow you to use [WebJars](https://www.webjars.org/) in your Wicket 1.4 based project.

## s3index

AWS S3 does not provide a fancy directory listing like most webservers produce. [s3index](https://github.com/mpobjects/s3index) will give a more fancy directory listing of your S3 buckets. It is a single file script which you can run directly from your S3 bucket.
